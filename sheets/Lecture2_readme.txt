1. Please unzip the folder, or copy the parent folder "Lecture2Assignments" inside the zip file, to another path.
2. Open Lecture2Homepage first to land in the home page. Please navigate from there next.
For week 2's assignment, I have personal portfolio / CV site as requested, using HTML and CSS only.
There is only 1 page to the website :

-Lecture2Homepage,

structured with HTML, and only 1 external css style sheet : 

-styles.css.
--
For color, I have kept it to a simple theme, of black, red and white for contrast.
The rest of the site has been arranged and styled in a more typical modern portfolio/cv way, 
with a 2 column layout, nav bar with anchor links smooth scrolling enabled, footer, image gallery,
and a minimalistic / clean enough look.


There is a contact us section with a mailing and calling option at the end, which when clicked  on, will open your PC's / phone's
mailing, and telephone app.

FOR CREATIVITY : 

I tried out some fun effects such 
1. smooth scroll upon clicking the nav bar links, 
2. transform and keyframes (which will work only when the page is refreshed) for the "Hi" and "Welcome to my page" messages,
3. zoom effects on hovering over images, for the image gallery and top of the page image,
4. linked project from assignment 1 in the projects section, with a hover option that will display a small screenshot.
